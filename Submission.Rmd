##About:
This is the first course project for Reproducible Research, carried out on CourseEra platform. 


##Synopsis
The purpose of this project was to practice:

* loading and preprocessing data
* imputing missing values
* interpreting data to answer research questions

## Data
The data for this assignment was downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

##Loading and Preprocessing of Data

```{r}
temp <- tempfile()
        download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
        unzip(temp)
        unlink(temp)
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Sum steps by day, create Histogram, and calculate mean and median.

```{r}
png(file="plot1.png")
steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
dev.off()
```
![Average Number of Steps Per Da](E:\\College_Work\\CourseEra\\DataScience\\RepData_PeerAssessment1\plot1.png)

```{r}
rmean <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
```

The `mean` is 1.0766 and the `median` is 10765.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

* Calculate average steps for each interval for all days. 
* Plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval. 
* Find interval with most average steps. 

```{r}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
png(file="plot2.png")
plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
dev.off()
```

![Average Daily Activity Patten](plot2.png)

```{r}
max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
```

The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is 835.

## Impute missing values. Compare imputed to non-imputed data.
Missing data needed to be imputed. Only a simple imputation approach was required for this assignment. 
Missing values were imputed by inserting the average for each interval. Thus, if interval 10 was missing on 10-02-2012, the average for that interval for all days (0.1320755), replaced the NA. 

```{r}
incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
imputed_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_by_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_by_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```

Recount total steps by day and create Histogram. 

```{r}
steps_by_day_i <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_data, sum)
png("plot3.png")
hist(steps_by_day_i$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
#Create Histogram to show difference. 
hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="red", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("blue", "red"), lwd=10)
dev.off()
```

Calculate new mean and median for imputed data. 

```{r}
rmean.i <- mean(steps_by_day_i$steps)
rmedian.i <- median(steps_by_day_i$steps)
```

Calculate difference between imputed and non-imputed data.

```{r}
mean_diff <- rmean.i - rmean
med_diff <- rmedian.i - rmedian
```

Calculate total difference.

```{r}
total_diff <- sum(steps_by_day_i$steps) - sum(steps_by_day$steps)
```
* The imputed data mean is 1.059
* The imputed data median is 1.0766
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is -176.4949
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is 1.1887
* The difference between total number of steps between imputed and non-imputed data is 7.5363. Thus, there were 7.5363  more steps in the imputed data.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Created a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.  

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
imputed_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(imputed_data$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))

steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_data, mean)

library(lattice)
png("plot4.png")
xyplot(steps_by_interval_i$steps ~ steps_by_interval_i$interval|steps_by_interval_i$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
dev.off()
```
